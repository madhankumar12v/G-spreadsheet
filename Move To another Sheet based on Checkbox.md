## To automatically append rows to another sheet in Google Sheets when a checkbox is ticked, you can use Google Apps Script. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting it up:

* Open your Google Sheets document.

* Create a new sheet to store the appended rows. For this example, let's name it "Appended Data."

* In the menu bar, click on "Extensions" and select "Apps Script" to open the Apps Script editor.

* In the Apps Script editor, delete any existing code and replace it with the following code:
```

function onEdit(e) {
  var sourceSheet = e.source.getActiveSheet();
  var targetSheet = e.source.getSheetByName("Moved Data");
  var range = e.range;

  // Check if the edited cell is in the desired column (e.g., column A for the checkbox)
  if (range.getColumn() == 1) {
    // Check if the edited cell is checked
    if (range.isChecked()) {
      var row = range.getRow();
      var lastColumn = sourceSheet.getLastColumn();
      var data = sourceSheet.getRange(row, 1, 1, lastColumn).getValues();

      // Append the row to the "Moved Data" sheet
      targetSheet.appendRow(data[0]);

      // Delete the ticked row
      sourceSheet.deleteRow(row);
    }
  }
}

```

* Save the script by clicking on the floppy disk icon or by pressing Ctrl + S.

* Close the Apps Script editor.

Now, whenever you tick a checkbox in column A, the corresponding row will be appended to the "Appended Data" sheet, and the checkbox cell will be cleared.

Note: This script uses the onEdit trigger, which means it will run whenever any edit is made in the spreadsheet. Make sure you only tick checkboxes in column A to avoid unintended behavior.
